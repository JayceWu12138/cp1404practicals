## Introduction
### About the Author
I'm JintaoWu.
## Lessons Learned
Throughout this subject, I have learned several valuable lessons about writing clean code, which are crucial for any software development project:
- **Readability Matters**: Writing code that is easy to read and understand by others is just as important as getting the code to work.
- **Keep It Simple**: The best code is the one that accomplishes a task in the simplest way possible without unnecessary complexity.
- **Refactoring is Key**: Continuously improving and simplifying the code without changing its behavior can lead to more efficient and maintainable software.
## Projects Overview
Here's a brief overview of three key projects contained within this repository:
### Language File Reader
- **Objective**: Develop a Python program to read programming languages details from a file and display them using custom classes and file handling techniques.
- **Key Concepts**: File I/O, class design, list manipulation.
### Guitars
- **Objective**: Create a Python application to manage a collection of guitars, including their details like name, year made, and cost, showcasing object-oriented programming principles.
- **Key Concepts**: Object-oriented programming, sorting, and filtering data based on user-defined criteria.
### Project Management System
- **Objective**: Implement a project management system that allows loading, saving, displaying, and updating project details from a file, demonstrating advanced file handling and user interaction.
- **Key Concepts**: File I/O, datetime manipulation, menu-driven console application.
